# 🌱 Understanding Core Programming Fundamentals

Before diving into any programming language, it's important to understand the **core programming fundamentals**. These are the **universal building blocks** of programming — the core concepts that almost every language shares.

Think of them as the "grammar and logic" of code. Once you understand them, you can adapt to **any programming language** with ease, whether it's Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, or Rust.

---

## 💡 Why Are Programming Fundamentals Important?

Learning a specific programming language is like learning to speak a new language. But just like all languages share basic grammar rules (nouns, verbs, sentences), all programming languages share common **fundamentals**.

### 🎯 If you understand the fundamentals, you can:
- **Think like a programmer** – break down problems into logical steps.
- **Switch languages easily** – because the logic stays the same.
- **Write clean, structured, and readable code.**
- **Understand documentation** and examples written in other languages.
- **Learn advanced topics faster** (like frameworks, APIs, or algorithms).

## 🧱 What Are the Core Programming Concepts?

| Concept           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Variables**     | Containers for storing information (like numbers or text). |
| **Expressions**   | Code that combines values and operators to produce new values. |
| **Control Structures** | Logic that decides what your program does next (e.g., if statements, loops). |
| **Methods / Functions** | Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. |
| **Classes & Objects** | A way to group data and behavior (used in object-oriented programming). |

---

These concepts are the **foundation of all software development**. Once you master them, learning new tools, libraries, or even entire languages becomes much easier.

# 🔑 Core Programming Concepts (with Java Examples)

Understanding the core concepts of programming is essential. These fundamentals exist in almost every programming language, and once you master them, you can switch to any language easily.

Below are the **five key programming fundamentals**, each explained with beginner-friendly descriptions and real Java code examples.

---

## 1. 📦 Variables

### 🔍 What is a Variable?
A **variable** is a container used to store data in your program — like a number, a word, or a value that can change.

### 🧠 Why it's important:
Variables allow us to **store information**, **manipulate it**, and **reuse it** throughout the program.

### 🧪 Java Example:
```java
int age = 18;
String name = "Juan";
double height = 5.9;

System.out.println("Name: " + name);
System.out.println("Age: " + age);
System.out.println("Height: " + height);
````

### 📘 Explanation:

* `int`, `String`, and `double` are **data types**.
* `age`, `name`, and `height` are **variable names**.
* The `=` assigns values to the variables.

---

## 2. 🧮 Expressions

### 🔍 What is an Expression?

An **expression** is a combination of **variables**, **values**, and **operators** that produces a result.

### 🧠 Why it's important:

Expressions are used to **calculate**, **compare**, and **assign** values. Most logic in programming comes from expressions.

### 🧪 Java Example:

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;
int sum = a + b;
int product = a * b;

System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
System.out.println("Product: " + product);
```

### 📘 Explanation:

* `a + b` is an expression that adds two numbers.
* `a * b` multiplies them.
* The result is stored in new variables (`sum`, `product`).

---

## 3. 🔁 Control Structures

### 🔍 What are Control Structures?

Control structures are commands that **control the flow** of a program. They include:

* **Conditional Statements** (if, else)
* **Loops** (for, while)

### 🧠 Why it's important:

They let you make decisions and repeat actions.

---

### ✅ Conditional Example (if-else):

```java
int score = 85;

if (score >= 75) {
    System.out.println("You passed!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Try again.");
}
```

### 🔁 Loop Example (for loop):

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Number: " + i);
}
```

### 📘 Explanation:

* `if` checks if a condition is true.
* `for` repeats code while a condition is met.
* These structures make your program *dynamic* and *responsive*.

---

## 4. 🔧 Methods (Functions)

### 🔍 What is a Method?

A **method** is a reusable block of code that performs a task. It’s like a mini-program inside your program.

### 🧠 Why it's important:

* Avoid repeating code.
* Organize your logic.
* Make your code easier to read and maintain.

---

### 🧪 Java Example:

```java
public static void greet(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    greet("Anna");
    greet("Mark");
}
```

### 📘 Explanation:

* `greet` is a method that takes one input: `name`.
* The method is called (used) inside `main()`.
* You can reuse it multiple times with different inputs.

---

## 5. 🧱 Classes and Objects

### 🔍 What is a Class?

A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It groups related **data (variables)** and **behavior (methods)**.

### 🔍 What is an Object?

An **object** is an instance of a class — a real thing created from the class template.

### 🧠 Why it's important:

* Organizes code like real-world models.
* Core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

### 🧪 Java Example:

```java
public class Person {
    // Attributes (data)
    String name;
    int age;

    // Method (behavior)
    void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hi, my name is " + name + " and I'm " + age + " years old.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Person object
        Person p1 = new Person();
        p1.name = "Carlos";
        p1.age = 20;
        p1.sayHello();

        Person p2 = new Person();
        p2.name = "Maria";
        p2.age = 18;
        p2.sayHello();
    }
}
```

### 📘 Explanation:

* `Person` is the class.
* `p1` and `p2` are objects of that class.
* Each object has its own data and can use the class method.
